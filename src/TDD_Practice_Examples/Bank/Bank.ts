//You have been asked to create a banking application
//The bank can keep track of how much money it has, and how much it has loaned.
//Customers have a saving account, checking account, and need to be able to transfer money between the two.
//Customers need to be able to deposit and withdraw money
//Customers can also take out loans from the bank, and need to be able to view them
//The interest rate starts at 2.5% and doubles for every additional loan a customer takes out (but the other loans stay the same: loan 1 2.5%, loan 2 is 5%, etc)
//Robbers can come in an rob a customer at random (empty their accounts)
//Robinhood can come in and relieve a customer of their loans at random
